>Housing Units Per Year
In this section, what was calculated was the number of housing units per year and visualized the results as a bar chart using the Pandas plot function.

>Average Gross Rent in San Francisco Per Year
In this section, the project visualized the average gross rent per year to better understand the trends for rental income over time. The project visualized the average (mean) gross rent per year and visualized it as a line chart.

>Average Sales Price Per Year
In this section, the project determined average sales price per year to better understand the sales price of the rental property over time. For example, a person will want to know if they should expect an increase or decrease in the property value over time so they can determine how long to hold the rental property. The project visualized the average (mean) sales_price_sqr_foot as a bar chart.
